A studint project that creates Polynom and Monom.
Also do simple metods on them.

#Monom:
This class represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where b is a real number and a is an integer (summed a none negative), see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial The class implements function and support simple operations as: construction, value at x, derivative, add and multiply.

#Polynom:
This class represents a Polynom with add, multiply functionality, it also should support the following: 1. Riemann's Integral: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral 2. Finding a numerical value between two values (currently support root only f(x)=0). 3. Derivative

#Junit test:
a test in a Junit format, using asserts (assertEqual, assertTrue).
there are some tests that check specific cases.

#plotGraph:
this class print your Polynom as a graph, gives also min and max point and It also shows the area of the function under the X axis.
this class isn't originaly writen be us, it's from a Github project.
in order to use plotGraph you need to have XChart: https://github.com/knowm/xchart.

*** can comtain unintended bugs.
