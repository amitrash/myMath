A studint project that creates Polynom and Monom.
Also do simple metods on them.

#Monom:
This class represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where b is a real number and a is an integer (summed a none negative), see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial The class implements function and support simple operations as: construction, value at x, derivative, add and multiply.

#Polynom:
This class represents a Polynom with add, multiply functionality, it also should support the following: 1. Riemann's Integral: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral 2. Finding a numerical value between two values (currently support root only f(x)=0). 3. Derivative
